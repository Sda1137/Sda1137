I'm software Developer, I specialize in  Apple plaform, I work exclusively with native tech, so my wapon of choc e are C & C++, Objective-C and Swift. although I enjoy workign with C++,I'm not a expert in C++ just yet. I find the field of system programming very interrestiing and I find it realy enjoyable as well a very chanllenging at times but diving peed into the concept is sonthing I find desarable.
